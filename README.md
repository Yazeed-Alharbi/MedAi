MedAi is our project for the SWE 363 course (Web Engineering and Development) at KFUPM. It is a smart platform designed to quickly provide doctors with a comprehensive and complete look at a patient's health record. The main motivation behind MedAi is to eliminate the need for patients to provide their medical history and details when they visit a new healthcare facility. In addition, this motivation extends to presenting the patient information in a clear and concise manner to help doctors in making informed decisions.
